### Welcome to my Github repository

Greetings and welcome to my Github repository, my name is Raúl Fernández-Díaz and I am a bioinformatician with a background in biotechnology currently seeking to specialise myself in deep learning applications to biomedicine. In this repository, you will find some projects I have worked on. As of now I have made public the code I developed for the HarvardX CS50's courses on AI programming with Python and Game Development, as well as a little project I have worked on during the quarentine related to my Bachelor's Thesis on MATLAB language. Although my professional focus is on AI devlopment, I also find scientific divulgation intriguing and I have taught a workshop at the VII SECUAH Congress at "Alcalá de Henares" University (Madrid). In the repository, "Aprendizaje_profundo_en_biomedicina" I have collected the materials I created for the workshop which include a Google Collaboratory (Jupyter) Notebook that contains all the necessary code for training a simple DCNN for diagnosisng skin lessions as either bening or cancerous.
