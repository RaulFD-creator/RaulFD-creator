### Welcome to my Github repository

Greetings and welcome to my Github repository, my name is Raúl Fernández Díaz and I am a bioinformatician with a background in biotechnology, currently specialising in deep learning applications to biochemistry. In this repository, you may find some projects I am working on. 

Though my professional focus is on AI development, I also find scientific divulgation and teaching fascinating and have taught a workshop at the VII SECUAH Congress at "Alcalá de Henares" University (Madrid). In the repository, "Aprendizaje profundo en biomedicina" I have collected the materials I created for the workshop which include a Google Collaboratory (Jupyter) Notebook with all the necessary code for training a simple deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for diagnosing skin lessions as either bening or cancerous.
