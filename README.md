# Welcome to my Github repository

Greetings and welcome to my Github repository, my name is Raúl Fernández Díaz and I'm a PhD Student working under the supervision of Prof. Denis Shields (UCD Conway Institute) and Thanh Lam Hoang (IBM Research) on Foundation Models for Protein Representation Learning. I hold a BSc. in Biotechnology and a MSc. in Bioinformatics, which allow me to tackle the complex idiosyncrasies of working at the interface between computation, statistics, biology, and chemistry with a holistic approach. In this repository, you may find some projects I am working on. 

##  Application of Foundation Models on Biochemistry

One of my professional focuses is the application of novel Foundation Models like Protein Language Models for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly on the fields of biochemistry and drug discovery. This section contains my work in that area:

- **AutoPeptideML:** an end-to-end, user-friendly application and web service that enables experimental researchers to build their own custom models for peptide bioactivity prediction for drug discovery. This is an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tool to tackle challenges ranging from data acquisition (small dataset sizes, sparse labeling) to peptide representation, independence of evaluation datasets and interpretation of results. It does so by leveraging large FMs (Protein Language Models), a novel homology partitioning algorithm and simplifying the process for users with limited ML knowledge, promoting reproducibility and best practices. There is a dedicated [webserver](http://peptide.ucd.ie/AutoPeptideML) and a [Github Repository](https://github.com/IBM/AutoPeptideML).


## Scientific divulgation

Though my professional focus is on AI development, I also find scientific divulgation and teaching fascinating. Here are some of the projects related to that aspect of my work.

- **VII SECUAH Congress:** Workshop titled "Aprendizaje profundo en biomedicina" - Deep Learning on Biomedicine. I've taught a cohort of biosciences students (undergrad and graduate) about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning techniques and how to apply them to biomedical research. The workshop lasted 4 h and finished with a guided practical example where every student was able to build their own deep convolutional neural network for diagnosing skin lessions as either bening or cancerous. Materials can be found in this [Github Repository](https://github.com/RaulFD-creator/Aprendizaje_profundo_en_biomedicina).
